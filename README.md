# Customers-Segmentation
STP(Abbreviation for Segmentation,Targeting, Positioning) is a fundamental marketing framework. It can be applied to all areas of business and marketing activities. The process of dividing a population of customers into groups that share similar characteristics. Observations within the same group would have comparable purchasing behavior. Observations within the same group would respond similarly to different marketing activities.

The notebook focuses on how to perform customer segmentation, using a hands-on approach. It involves the application of hierarchical and flat clustering techniques for dividing customers into groups. It also features applying the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, as well as combining PCA and K-means for an even more professional customer segmentation.
